This is a GreaseMonkey script that adds a "delete" button on individual plurk
page. This way you can delete your or other people plurks (if it's your
thread) from the plurk page itself.

This script was written by Peteris Krumins (peter@catonmat.net).

How to install this script?
---------------------------

You will need FireFox browser and GreaseMonkey plugin. If you have them,
please proceed to step 3. Otherwise also do steps 1 and 2. 

Step 1. Download and install FireFox browser. It can be downloaded at the
following address: http://www.mozilla.com/firefox/

Step 2. Install GreaseMonkey FireFox addon. GreaseMonkey allows you to modify
any page (like this one adds translation feature to Plurk's page). GreaseMonkey
can be downloaded here: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/748

Step 3. Install this script. The latest version is always at GreaseMonkey
script repostiory:

    http://userscripts.org/scripts/source/63085.user.js

Open this link with FireFox and click "Install".

Now you can delete plurks from the individual plurk page. (By individual plurk
page I mean plurks with URL http://www.plurk.com/p/<something>).

The script will add "delete" button next to your own plurks.

The script will add "delete" button to all the plurks if you are the owner of
the thread (the original plurk).
